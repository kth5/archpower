## Silent ABI breakages

New libconfig release *may* include *silent* ABI breakage (see e.g. https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/libconfig/-/issues/2).  
As such, out of precaution, it is encouraged to rebuild linked reverse dependencies to avoid any unexpected breakages (see e.g. https://archlinux.org/todo/libconfig-18-rebuild/).
