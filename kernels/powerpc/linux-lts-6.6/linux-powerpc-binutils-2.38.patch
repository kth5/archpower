+ * gcc 10 started to emit a .machine directive at the beginning of generated
+ * .s files, which overrides assembler -Wa,-m<cpu> options passed down.
+ * Unclear if this behaviour will be reverted.
+ *
+ * gas 2.38 commit b25f942e18d6 made .machine directive more strict, commit
+ * cebc89b9328ea weakens it to take into account the gcc directive and allow
+ * assembler -m<cpu> options to work.
+ *
+ * A combination of both results in an older machine -mcpu= code generation
+ * preventing newer mneumonics in inline asm being recognised because it
+ * overrides our -Wa,-many option from being recognised.
+ *
+ * Emitting a .machine any directive by hand allows us to hack our way around
+ * this.
+ *
+ * XXX: verify versions and combinations.
