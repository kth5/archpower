.TH KEYBOXD "1" "March 2022" "kbxutil (GnuPG) 2.4.1" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
keyboxd \- Public key management for GnuPG

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B keyboxd
.RB [ OPTIONS ]
.RB [ COMMAND ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
keyboxd is a public key management service for GnuPG.

.SH COMMANDS

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

.TP
.B \-\-version
Print  the program version and licensing information.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
options.
.TP
.B \-\-server
Run in server mode and wait for commands on the \fBstdin\fR.  The default
mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.  This is
only used for testing.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon
Run in background daemon mode and listen for commands on a socket.
This is the way \fBkeyboxd\fR is started on demand by the other GnuPG
components.  To force starting \fBkeyboxd\fR it is in general best to use
\fBgpgconf \-\-launch keyboxd\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-supervised
Run in the foreground, sending logs to stderr, and listening on file
descriptor 3, which must already be bound to a listening socket.  This
is useful when running under systemd or other similar process
supervision schemes.  This option is not supported on Windows.


.SH OPTIONS

Note that all long options with the exception of \fB\-\-options\fR
and \fB\-\-homedir\fR may also be given in the configuration file
after stripping off the two leading dashes.

.TP
.B  \-\-options \fIfile\fR
Reads configuration from \fIfile\fR instead of from the default
per-user configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
\(oq\fIkeyboxd.conf\fR\(cq and expected in the home directory.

.TP
.B  \-\-homedir \fIdir\fR
Set the name of the home directory to \fIdir\fR.  This option is only
effective when used on the command line.  The default is
the directory named \(oq\fI.gnupg\fR\(cq directly below the home directory
of the user unless the environment variable \fBGNUPGHOME\fR has been set
in which case its value will be used.  Many kinds of data are stored within
this directory.


.TP
.B  \-v
.TP
.B  \-\-verbose
Outputs additional information while running.
You can increase the verbosity by giving several
verbose commands to \fBkeyboxd\fR, such as \fB\-vv\fR.


.TP
.B  \-\-log\-file \fIfile\fR
Append all logging output to \fIfile\fR.  This is very helpful in
seeing what the agent actually does.  Use \(oq\fIsocket://\fR\(cq to log to
socket.

.TP
.B  \-\-debug\-level \fIlevel\fR
Select the debug level for investigating problems.  \fIlevel\fR may be a
numeric value or by a keyword:

.RS
.TP
.B  none
No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used instead of
the keyword.
.TP
.B  basic
Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be used
instead of the keyword.
.TP
.B  advanced
More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be used
instead of the keyword.
.TP
.B  expert
Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be used
instead of the keyword.
.TP
.B  guru
All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8 may be
used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash tracing files is
only enabled if the keyword is used.
.RE

How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
specified and may change with newer releases of this program. They are
however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

.TP
.B  \-\-debug \fIflags\fR
Set debugging flags.  This option is only useful for debugging and its
behavior may change with a new release.  All flags are or-ed and may
be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a comma separated list of
flag names.  To get a list of all supported flags the single word
"help" can be used.

.TP
.B  \-\-debug\-all
Same as \fB\-\-debug=0xffffffff\fR

.SH FILES

Keyboxd uses a configuration file which controls the operation of
keyboxd.  By default they may all be found in the current home
directory (see: [option \-\-homedir]).

.TP
.B  keyboxd.conf
This is the standard configuration file read by \fBkeyboxd\fR on
startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes
may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This file
is also read after a \fBSIGHUP\fR however not all options will
actually have an effect.  This default name may be changed on the
command line (see: [option \-\-options]).  You should backup this file.

.TP
.B  pubring.db
This file is a database in SQLite format, for public key material.
You should backup this file.
